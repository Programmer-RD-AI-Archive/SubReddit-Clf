I found time to write a bit so here it goes! Remember BIL is dating now SIL and he's now thinking of marrying her. We were sitting in the room at the il's house just us three. BIL is talking to DH about it. SIL has a dog that she's had for years. It was a gift to her by her father when he became very ill, near death. The reality hit him that life is short and he decided to start making good on some of his promises before he died. He always told SIL he would get her a dog, they were a military family, and he'd always say the next place we move I'll get it for you. So he got her this dog at that time and she loves her dog and he has sentimental value to her. Now, BIL has not yet met this dog because you know it's serious when you meet the dog. BIL sates to DH: Well the dog has to go. I have allergies and I can't be living with a dog. I know the dog has sentimental meaning for her because of her dad but my health is more important than a dog. She's waiting for me to meet the dog because she wants him to slowly warm up to me. This is stupid, it's just a dog... I don't see what the big deal is. I want to marry her but if we get married we'll already have to get an apartment and that costs money there (both of them at the time were living with their parents and would meet each other for dates and such). If we keep the dog then we have to pay extra money for pet rent and I'm not paying extra money for a dog!!! DH is just nodding his head and listening (he's pretty laid back and quiet always like this guess it's true opposites attract). I'm thinking how rude is this guy? He wants to marry her and is supposed to love her but can't have compassion for what she loves??? I know he's SNOT JR. For sure. Anyway he meets the dog and they get engaged. They have all these big events that I find my way out of because I can't stand being around them. They had a family celebration right after he proposed and a joint couple shower. SNW knows how creative and crafty I am, especially after my wonderful diy wedding decor, so she asks me to help her decorate for the rehearsal dinner. I reluctantly agree to help her. DH and I have been married over 3 years at this point. SNW has never made any efforts to call, text, smoke signal, or communicate with me in any way or form any relationship with me. Can't remember if I posted about this before but I did invite her to an event to be the bigger person, but she basically fought me even giving it to her. The event was based on a book and I wanted to buy her the book and put the tickets inside as a Christmas gift. She was like oh I don't want a book. And then proceeded to text DH about how she doesn't want whatever I'm trying to get her, that he knows the type of gifts she likes and to stick to that. I was so angry... I was raised knowing when people get you a gift you accept because the person thought about you and took their time to get it for you so be grateful! Guess not everyone learned that. I still invite her after my moms advise but said well I was trying to do this for you but since you didn't want it I'm asking you now would you like to go with me. Then she's like oh I would love to go I had no idea thats what it was, super nice in front of everyone. We went to the event and she straight up did not talk to me the whole time and went off in her own during the intermissions. Sorry for going off topic but you get the point. Now all of a sudden she's blowing me up about this wedding rehearsal. She texts several times a day and calls about her ideas and sends me pics. She's always like Hi how are you then goes for what she wants... I'm not fooled at all, she never cared how I was doing for over three years. She says Oh well SIL and I have been talking about the plans and blah blah blah. Basically trying to run in my face that she talks to SIL all the time and she's being involved in the planning. unlike with my wedding, but that's because she got mad at me for not doing what she wanted and did CBF the rest of the time I was planning. I tell DH about this sudden change of behavior and how much involved SNW is in this wedding as compared to ours. He suggests well maybe because she has a good relationship with SIL she realizes she needs to do better with you and this is her way of reaching out to you... I say maybe but I know its all fake..."

Is there any way I can quickly cure them for aquarium use? My understanding is that you don't want to put green branches into an aquarium. I've got a couple small tanks (5.5g, 2.5g) that I'd like to put these in, but only if I don't have to leave them outside for year(s) first. The branches are small, the biggest one has a maximum diameter of 0.75 inches, but they're mostly closer to 0.25-0.5 inches. The outer black bark is gone, but the inner red bark is still on them. Here's my questions: 1) Is there any way I can quickly dry them out in an oven or something? Would they be safe to boil and use at that point? 2) Usually the things I've read say that the bark needs to be removed or it'll slowly peel off. As long as it were to not peel off in tiny pieces, and as long as it were safe, I wouldn't mind that. I don't have a sandblaster to remove bark with either. Is it out of the question to leave the bark on? (ie is it super obnoxious or toxic?) Thanks guys!"

Even though some may think that what you do is abnormal or unusual, what matters the most is that you have confidence in yourself and in what you are doing.

And it doesn't mean there are no talented women (really?); just that by-and-large women and men tend to have slightly different talents and inclinations. What we need is equality of opportunity, and a willingness not to stereotype on the basis of aggregate behaviours, rather than equality of outcome.

I've often created fun and interesting decks for non-competitive play. I like to try strange decks just to see if I can get them to work. I think it's fun and it's one of the ways I have found to alleviate frustration when grinding ladder. A problem, though, is that I'll make a funky pirate shaman deck or a rogue deck with only two minions, etc. and want to just dick around and have fun with it. I'll go into casual and lose to aggro shaman or control Mage enough times that I feel like I should be playing a ranked deck to have a little more fun, and I'm back to grinding ladder. This brings me to my point. You can choose the class you play against in practice mode, letting you see how your deck fares in certain match ups. I think it would be fun and innovating to be able to choose a deck for the innkeeper to play against you. This could have practical benefits (like a mirror match to test out changes in a ranked deck) or it could be really fun (giving the innkeeper a golden Milhouse Manastorm). It could even be used to mess with deck interplay (thief rogue against a stacked deck). What do you guys think?"

Take Ronin for example, the sword titan. Often, he states ""We are stronger together, pilot"" and it's true. With his processing speed, algorithms and logic combined with a humans intuition and risk/reward assessment (robots err on one side or the other, a human does not) they can make combined decisions leading to the best outcome. Also. A human can sacrifice themselves, a titan cannot sacrifice their pilot. Alone they are formidable, but together, they are only challenged by an equal."

Let me start by saying power creep will always be a thing in WF and I do not see that ever stopping. I do however believe that DE has taken some steps to slowing it. Passives are amazing! They change not only how you build weapons and what you decide to use but also how you play the game. A perfect example is the Telos Boltace which is quickly becoming a go to melee. Is it as powerful as the Galatine Prime? Debatable, but for killing a single tanky target no. But the way you play with the Telos Boltace changes everything. A somewhat good example of how weapon passives change the game is the Borderlands series. I would never want to see WF be as crazy as Borderlands, but some this are already starting to line up. For instance the Fomorian Accelerant mod for the Drakgoon adds a passive to make shots bounce off walls. This is similar to the Conferance Call shotgun in Borderlands 2. Furis's Winds of Purity mod turns it into a Moxie weapon. Why cant warframe have weapons that you can throw the clip out to explode doing damage equal to the bullets remaining? Or a sniper rifle the shoots a volley like Ivaras bow? Just add more cool passives and players will build around them."

I really would like to appreciate all my peeps who make devoted as dank as it is. No other way to put it, really. I love how its a fairly relaxing civilization server instead of CivCraft. Less grind = more fun for everyone. Without factories on Civ - you couldn't do much at all. Here, you can thrive with or without them. No, I don't hate Civcraft because I do play fairly often and I've made quite the bunch of friends there. I've seen development yet it was very slow. But this ain't no complainin post about Civ. This is my post about appreciating devoted for what it is. So even though I just started devoted and I knew right from the start when 3.0 of devoted launched that the experience would be amazing and I wasn't dissapointed. This server is great. To the staff: keep up the hard work! If you agree with me, leave an upvote or reply with your thoughts on Devoted! Thanks for your time. Stay dank. -tnug out."

And Poland was already gearing for war with Germany. Plus Poland at the time was in control of parts of Prussia and Silesia and treating the national Germans like shit. The Polish were even killing them. Hitler had every right to invade Poland in my opinion and the only reason we went to war was because the British and French were afraid of Germany threatening their colonial power. But it's really all just a matter of opinion."

I'm not going to go all hypothesis testy for this, but we can certainly calculate a confidence interval on his measurement. If we believe that p = 1/3 and we have enough data points (which at nearly 300,000 we do), we can estimate a standard error for our measured p using sqrt{p(1-p)/n}. A 95% confidence interval would then be 1.96*se(p) = 0.00086. Given the actual data we can say with 95% confidence that misha's true summoning rate falls within the interval 33.38% +- 0.086% or [33.29%, 33.47%]. Increasing n an order of magnitude to just about 3 million games, would bring the lower limit of our confidence interval to 33.35%, which is above 1/3. We would need about 3 million games to more properly test the claim that Misha might be summoned at a rate higher than 1/3.

My trial would take place in a cavern, likely somewhere on Poni Island, would specialize in Dragon types(as that is the type of my Friend Safari), and will put your mind to the test. I will greet you at the entrance of the cavern and send you off on your quest to complete 3 tasks in order to meet the ""Old Wise One"", monitoring you along the way. You enter the first room and do first task: a quiz about basic Pokemon facts and trivia. Once you complete it, you will battle a trainer. You go into the second room to do the second task, which is one or two Strength puzzles. After you complete it, you battle another trainer. The third room is cold and icy. In here is the third task, a small set of ice puzzles. After you traverse those, you battle the final trainer, and make it into the final room, where the ""Old Wise One"", a Totem Drampa, awaits. Beat him to obtain your reward(whatever that may be), and clear the trial."

Is it just me because I believe the player models need to have some blood where the injuries are. Such as in melee animations to add some immersion and details to each player model. When I play games I really love the small details that just impresses me, since most games these days (looking at COD) who don't put the small details in. The video of how Ubisoft downgrades really opened my eyes and even though the Battlefield series is nowhere close I just fear that someday video games will just be entertainment and not art. Dice has done a great job and Im not dissing them, but if somehow they could pull this of I would be extremely impressed."

We all knew what we were getting with her - we know what she did - we aren't wearing blinders and disassociating ourselves from reality. She does shady shit. On the other side you have Trump, who in the past CONTRIBUTED MONEY TO CLINTONS CAMPAIGN, lives in Trump tower, and runs alongside born and bred politician Mike Pence, somehow convinces salt of the earth middle America that he is their man. You want to talk MSM brainwashing? There's so many steps between Trump and the common man, along with his ""drain the swamp"" strategy that you literally have to be brainwashed to buy it. I have some timeshares and knife sets I'd also like to sell you.

I have seen a fair share of crazy liberal feminists who believe that women are entitled to everything because they are women, but I have also met plenty more women who work their ass off and achieve everything quite fairly. Now, the minority of women who support the *my choice* abortion are those who are, quite frankly, crazy. Again, those are the 'fringe' parts of liberalism. Classical liberalism is nothing like that. They believe in both rights *and* responsibilities. I am not even a liberal, I am a conservative and so I feel that all men and women should be free to do as they please with their body. The concept of body autonomy is essential to the functioning of human rights. If we do not have body autonomy then everything else falls apart and we certainly should not have the expectation that everyone will defend their freedom with the barrel of a gun because that's not how one should defend their freedom, unless absolutely necessary. Anyway, I think I am digressing a little. Don't use an internet forum as a barometer for what women think, especially two chromosomes. That place is an effective safe space, much like coontown or fatpeoplehate used to be. Plus, a lot of women think that 'being a man' is about acting like a dick and, so, a lot of young feministas basically act like that to try look 'hard and cool', like teenage boys.

I was working in a sunglass and lifestyle store when I got bored and decided to cover myself from head to toe in snowboarding gear. All the way from pants and jacket to gloves, facemask, goggles and hat. Not a single piece of skin was showing. I goofed off in the store for a bit and then decided to go stand in the big glass front window. This is where the FU happens. I am standing in there as still as can be and getting a couple of weird looks but nothing too strange. For the most part people aren't noticing me. Then a little kid (maybe 12 years old) comes right up to the glass and stares at me, obviously noticing something isn't right. That's when the practical joker in me takes over and I throw my hands up and scare the crap out of the little bugger. He runs off half scared half laughing and I leave the window display and get back to actually working. A few minutes later an older fellow comes in and says he saw what I did and that it was incredibly racist...ohh, I didn't mention that the little kid was black, because to a normal person they wouldn't even think in those terms. The older fellow was black too. He goes on to tell me that he's a professor at one of the Ivy League colleges across town and that he studies this kind of stuff regularly and that what I did was incredibly racist. He lectured me a bit more, and I just stood there and listened since I was so caught off guard then he finished by saying that it was because of people like me doing that kind of stuff that black people were afraid of white people. TLDR: pretended to be a mannequin. Scared a little kid who happened to be black. Got called a racist."

WWE used to mute Cena's reactions, pipe in chants, and run an edited version for the West coast feed (which aired on tape delay) for Cena. At the PPVs they could only mute it but it'd be obvious people were booing Cena, so many people that were on the West Coast would only hear the boos at PPVs and would be surprised. Maybe because of the proliferation of the internet they aren't trying to do that now. But Reigns actually does get cheers and the boos aren't even that bad. He gets booed on his entrance, but he's such a good wrestler that usually during and after his matches the crowd can't help but pop. Cena was a garbage wrestler so he'd just get booed throughout the matches. When Cena would fire up it'd be even worse. When Reigns fires up most people actually like to see the Superman punch and Spear. Cena of course lasted for a decade plus. I'm sure Reigns can do that too. I think Reigns outside of promo work is a way better wrestler than Cena already. He looks cooler, has cooler moves, sells a lot better and works better matches all around. Heck even his promos, I see more potential, because Cena would just make kiddy jokes mostly."

I feel like each can contribute and fit on any team that can get the ball in the basket. ***Realistically***, I'd say Bazemore (even though his value went up after a 11/5/2 season) and Rush are more likely to be traded for, rather than Hill and MKG.

At the time, I was around 25 and he was almost 30. It was his first 'real job' out of college. He apparently grew up in a very sheltered, religious household. His dad is apparently a very high-ranking official in the UN. And due to an unfortunate strings of circumstances, Kevin sat next to me: * Kevin had zero computer skills. As a new employee, the company will issue you the standard computer, 8GB flash drive, along with employee handbook, etc. etc. He refused the flash drive because the size was too small (physically) and he believed it won't have any storage capacity. * So he kept having to borrow my flash drive. He also didn't know how to plug it into his computer and kept complaining that the flash drive is ""broken"". * We're an international company with offices in many countries. So, it goes without saying that we all communicate through email. He drafts EVERY EMAIL (even simple replies) on PAPER and then asks me to proof read it before he sends it out. He works as a COPYWRITER. * He asked me if the ""SEND"" button in Outlook means that his email was sent out. * He has more than once got scammed by those Nigerian Prince emails. He sends them his password when they ask for it. * He likes to google my full name (it's not a common name at all. Only I have it.). He googles it often enough that it pops up every time he types in the first letter of my name on Google. One day, he got so excited and showed it to me because I was ""FAMOUS"" because Google knows my name. * Each month, the housekeeper would walk around and issue out tissue paper to put at our workstation. The first time, he asked me what it was. * He drives the cleaning ladies insane by going into the pantry, use plates and mugs and put them back in the cupboard without washing them. When confronted, his argument was that he'll use it again eventually. * He likes to listen in on conversations. More than once, he would ask me what people in five workstations away were talking about. * He stares at people. ALL. THE. TIME. And stare at your computer screen and comment on what you're working on. * He didn't know how to put staples in staplers. When I helped him with it, his reply: ""Thank you so much. I'm just not used to these new technologies."" * He constantly asks people how much their salary is. * His probation period was extended (understandably. he was still asking me to proofread his emails). When HR told him, he threw a tantrum claiming that they can't do that because he already told his mom that he passed the probation. * He often takes his copywriting work home for his mom to check. This is what I can think of from the top of my head. I'm know there's more as he drove me nuts to the point that I wanted to quit and the Head of HR had to console me. I was his designated babysitter for the duration of his time there. People still joke that one day he might come into the office and shoot everyone. I would be the first to go."

Beyond that we have all of the ships that have been sold that haven't been made yet. There were a few bursts of ship releases early in the year but that has slowed down tremendously with the patch rate in the last half of the year. Honestly if they want to crank ships sales out like this they need to separate ship drops from major patches. It's been nearly 3.5 months since 2.5 dropped and we got the Reliant and the Argo. In the first half of the year we got 6 new flyable ships. Which makes this last six months a slower rate of ships coming down the pipeline.

I'm not putting the blame on Singer or Apocalypse or anything really other than the entire franchise has kind of become tedious and the characters aren't exciting anymore. Deadpool and Quicksilver are the only two characters in the entire franchise that hold any interest for me personally, and they aren't enough to prop the whole thing up. Wolverine wasn't enough to prop the whole thing up from the beginning, but they got as much mileage out of him as possible and now it's time I believe for the whole thing to go into the vault for 5 years and then go full reboot with a whole new cast of actors playing the X-Men.

0,"I'd love to see another faction that uses power armor, but with a lot more variation",FlamingWings,Fallout,3,-1,-1,2016-11,2016-11-11 16:41:44,"Fallout Faction Idea This is going to be kind of long so I will add a TL;DR at the end I'm not even sure if there's going to be a new Fallout game out soon but I recently watched the FudgeMuppet video about the ideal Fallout New Orleans and it really got me thinking. One of the things I loved most about Fallout New Vegas was Caesar's Legion, in my opinion they're one of the coolest factions in the Fallout world so naturally I started to think about what, if any, role they would play in a new Fallout game. I think we can all agree on that the Legion ending from NV most likely won't be the canon ending. In my opinion the Mr. House ending is going to be, which leaves the question: What will happen to the Legion? I think the Legion will collapse, whether Ceasar lives or not won't change that. Without Caesar's leadership smaller fights will erupt amongst their own ranks, most likely resulting in the Legion splitting up into smaller groups. Some maybe going back to the tribes they originally were. If Caesar lives, this may take a bit longer. More important though, there will be people loyal to the old values of Caesar and the Legion. These splinter groups will, in my opinion, most likely be pushed out of old Legion territory, i.e. Arizona, Utah, Colorado and New Mexico, and further east. Which brings us to the state of Louisiana, and New Orleans (yeah I know Texas lies between New Mexico and Louisiana but ignore that for now. And Caesar's Legion was supposed to be in Texas anyway so we can work something out) So, here's what I'm thinking: Imagine you're exploring the swamps outside of New Orleans when you come upon a town. The town itself is built upon a small lake and held up by stilts which protects it from higher water levels and floods. This town is basically the New Reno of the region. Filled with booze, drugs, stripclubs and prostitutes. You enter the town and eventually end up talking to the mayor, a bartender or whatever. The person will mention something about a raider gang living deep in the swamp outside of the town and you will get a miscellaneous quest to go check it out. When searching for the gang you will travel on a small path through the swamp, when you're getting close to the quest marker a man dressed in rags with a bomb collar around his neck approaches you. He tells you about his ""employers"" and how they have work for you. He assures that you will be greatly rewarded for your services. He then gives you a quest to go and destroy the booze stills, or something in that style, in the New Reno-ish town. After completing the quest you return to the man and he tells you to follow him. The two of you travel down the small path, and coming up at the end of the path is a camp. Outside the walls of the camp there are people crucified, giving you a hint of what's to come. You enter the camp and is greeted by a person wearing weathered legionary armor. He welcomes you to the camp of The Cohort (or The Zealot's, Zealot's of Caesar or something like that, going to be calling them The Cohort for now) and gives you the story of the Legion, and a recap of what has happened since the second battle of Hoover Dam. This person won't be the leader of the faction but merely one in their ranks. He then proceeds to offer you a place in the group, maybe sending you out on a new quest to prove your worth. You continue to work for The Cohort and learn more about them. I want this really powerfull and mysterious character to lead them, sort of a Lanius figure, brutal but more charismatic. He must have other interests besides destruction. As you progress through the questline you eventually get called up to a meeting with this leader. He praises you for the work you have done and tells you that The Cohort has great plans for the wastes of New Orleans. He tells you about the second coming of The Legion, how you and the rest of his men will unite the tribes and towns of the region and eventually march on New Orleans, claiming it for The Legion. The whole idea of The Cohort is to give the player the choice to revive the dying Legion and finally giving it the Rome it deserves. I want them to have very similar values to those of the Legion, such as prohibiting the use of alcohol and drugs, using slaves and having a totalitarian dictator as a leader. They will also use the same roman hierarchy. I have more ideas but I feel that this is enough for now. Let me know what you think and if you want more. Also feel free to comment if you have any ideas to improve on mine! TL;DR I have this idea of a faction that will originate from Caesar's Legion from Fallout New Vegas that I would love to appear in a new Fallout game. Essentially you would be able to give The Legion its rebirth and unite the wastes of New Oreleans/Louisiana, or wherever the game takes place, under its flag."

One of the classic tropes of fantasy worlds is that the farther you go out into the wilds the more dangerous it becomes. Cities are safe, and the creatures you find near them are weak, but things get harder farther out. Bosses are always in ""the deepest part of the forest"" and such. It's hard to recreate this feeling in Minecraft because the only only factors affecting mob spawning are light level and the occasional spawner block. **There's little incentive to travel farther from your base than you must to find a dark area.** If you want to fight a lot of mobs, the best way is usually to build a spawn room rather than to explore the wilderness. And if you do decide to find mobs through exploring at night, they're basically the same difficulty anywhere you go. So, **what mods can you think of that could fix this?** I don't know of any, but I've thought of some ideas that could go into one: * The most basic mod for this would be to make beds prevent mob spawning within a radius of a chunk or two. * A more advanced one would have mob spawn rates slowly scale up with increasing distance from a chunk with a bed that's in a villager house or from the world spawn until they've scaled up or above the vanilla spawn rate. This would allow you to build relatively safe cities anywhere by placing a bed, but have wild lands in-between * Spawn rate could also be tied to y-level with the spawn rate increasing back towards or above normal as you dig down even if there's a bed/city above to simulate the classic dungeon-under-the-city trope in caves. (dungeons would also be a cool thing to spawn under villages in general but that's another mod in itself...) I'm not a great java coder, so there isn't a large chance I'll be able to make this myself. Any devs who find it interesting feel free to steal anything here. **What are your thoughts?** are there mods that already cover most of this?

John McAfee, who created it and is brilliant, sold the company for millions, basically retired and ex-patriot-ed himself to do whatever he felt like at the moment (which apparently included lots of drugs and hookers). After he sold it, the company that bought it (forget who) turned the antivirus into a bloated piece of shit which under-performed, and wormed its way into your OS to a point where you basically couldn't get rid of it. This is McAfee's fuck-you to the company that took his product and made his name into a joke in the IT community. In other words, McAfee got based."

Open theism simply claims that at least some of our choices are free in a libertarian sense (that it was possible for us to have done otherwise), and that God can't foreknow a libertarianly free choice because such knowledge is logically impossible: there is currently no truth value about what libertarian free choice I'll make tomorrow.

Since Clash Royale has become pretty competitive in it's life time, I think it would be a great idea to add something like casual mode. Right now you can only play ladder, tournies and challenges. Two of which need gems to be played (or you join a free tourny, but it's incredibly difficult to find one these days). Ladder is great and all, but you get frustrated really quick, so I don't see a reason why a casual mode shouldn't be added."

Just received an email for 10X Thank You points for online purchases (up to $1,000 or 10,000 TYP), in addition to the 1 point per $ base from 11/15 thru 12/31. This after receiving 10x TYP on gas, grocery, and restaurant up to 10,000 points per month since September. Not everyone it seems had their Sears Citi converted to the TYP system (and if you don't have the Citi Preferred, Premier, or Prestige, they would be the non valuable, non transferable points). But for those that have been able to combine their TYP accounts, it seems to be a pretty decent return."

It actually sort of worked out well for me, because I needed a flight to San Francisco next weekend for a conference. The best part is that I get reimbursed, so can't go wrong, right? Well, I had to purchase my ticket on October 4th to confirm my attendance, but when I called the Concierge the next day to ask about retroactive credit (because the category doesn't start until today), they said that they could not extended. I even explained that I also have the PRG, and having heard about the announcement on Tuesday and thinking it couldn't have worked out any better, would otherwise have put it on my PRG. I ended up cancelling the ticket thanks to United's 24-hour cancellation policy, but the price has since jumped in the past 24 hours to about $200 more for the transcon. However, the other reason I was pushed to cancel was because some of the logistics around the conference seem a bit sketchy. * They were supposed to contact me 3 weeks out (about 2 weeks ago) confirming my attendance. They did it only two days ago. * They needed a confirmed ticket to SFO as a way to confirm attendance, which I sent them two days ago almost as soon as I received their email. * I haven't received any more email since then. My plan was to book a hotel for the weekend as soon as they got back to me, but since they haven't... Anyhow, I think it'll work out in the end. If I have to pay the higher price for a ticket, it just means more points to look forward to in the future."

0,What is the significance of the widow lady?,Stridaar,MGTOW,4,-1,-1,2016-12,2016-12-22 08:34:00,"MGTOW fairy tale: the happy village a long time ago in a little village there was a farmer and a farmer's wife, a miller and a miller's wife, a baker and a baker's wife, a hunter and a hunter's wife, a tailor and a tailor's wife, a carpenter and a carpenter's wife, a smith and a smith's wife, a barber and a barber's wife, a shepherd and a shepherd's wife, a fisherman and a fisherman's wife, and also a seamstress whose husband had died in the war. the carpenter built houses for everyone and repaired everything that anyone needed repaired, and the tailor made enough clothes for everyone and the barber kept everyone groomed and pulled any sore teeth anyone had and the fisherman provided fish for everyone and so all the men made all the things that the village needed. the wives of the village spent their days keeping the homes clean and looking after all of the children and everyone was very happy except for the seamstress. she made the finest embroidery and worked with silks and made fine things for the wives, and in return the men provided her what she needed from their trades. but she was sad because the wives looked down on her and she missed her husband dearly. one day a stranger came to the village. she told all the villagers that she was a femalist (which is *not* a code word for an evil, blue-haired, Satan worshipping, bloodsucking cunt-witch) and she told the wives that they were unhappy. she told them that they were being held back from having their own trades because the men wanted to be powerful. and the wives heard this and became angry with their husbands. and the wives and the widow and the femalist wrote rules and brought the rules before a meeting of all the villagers and voted on them. the men, thinking that everything had always been fine without these rules voted no, but the wives and the widow outnumbered them, and all the rules passed. one rule stated that no crops would be planted until there had been an environmental impact survey. and so Mrs. Farmer became an environmental surveyor and Mr. Farmer could not sew his crops until she had done her work. another rule said that no structure should be built except according to a drawing from a certified architect. and so Mrs. Carpenter became an architect and her husband could not build until she had planned his work for him. still another rule forbid baking except in an approved food preparation facility. and so Mrs. Baker became a health inspector and the baker could not bake until his wife approved his kitchen. and so all of the wives had jobs that had to be done before the men could do their jobs. the carpenter did wonder how his wife, who knew nothing of the strength of materials or of the techniques of building would draw better houses than he did. and the barber wondered how his wife would know if he were doing a bad job and needed his license revoked. and likewise all of the men wondered how their own wife having a job telling him what to do would make his work any better. but they all agreed that it was good that the women be strong and independent and have their own jobs. and so the wives set to work. first Mrs. Carpenter drew an office building where they would all go to work, and since he had not permission to build anything else, the carpenter built the office. it took a long time and he had to work twice as hard and twice as long for a long time to catch up with everything else that fell to disrepair in that time, but he agreed that it was good that the women have an office to do their work. next Mrs. Baker arranged for her husband to bring the wives food in their offices every day. and so the baker had to stop baking each day to make the delivery and he had to work a little later each night and still could not finish as much food as he had prepared before, but he agreed that it was good for the wives to have bread and cakes at their office so that they could work and be strong and independent. and likewise all of the wives set as a condition of their approval for their husbands' professions that they provide whatever the wives needed in order to do their jobs. and all the men had to work a little harder, and have a little less to show for it, but all agreed that it was good. and when the wives got their paychecks they took all of their money to the seamstress and bought finery and extra things for themselves. and the seamstress made more money than she had ever had and she bought as much as she could use of all the products that all the men of the village made and she bought even more than she could use for she was a wise woman and liked to prepare in case she were ever unable to work. and the men took their goods home to their wives and there was not enough food for anyone and there was not enough clothes for anyone and there was not enough of anything that anyone needed. the men had not made as much of everything and the seamstress had purchased much of their produce and sold it on to other villages. and everyone was miserable but everyone agreed that it was good for the wives to be strong and independent. and then the femalist came back to the village and talked to all the wives at the office while their husbands were working. and they told her of their woes. and she told them that they were unhappy because the men were still holding them back. and she counted all of their paychecks and found that they would not be able to buy half of all of the goods that the village produced and that they were suffering under an oppressive ""wage gap"". and she told them that they needed new rules to give them equal pay to their husbands and that then they would be happy. and the women voted to raise their own pay to that of the men. and the widowed seamstress voted with them because she was a wise woman and knew that she could raise her prices if her customers had more money to spend. and things became even worse than before. the women still spent all their money on fine apparel for themselves and the village became even more starved for food and necessities. and the men all asked their wives to keep more of their money for family expenses, but the wives were cunning and had been warned by the femalist that this was ""financial abuse"". and things continued to get worse. and the femalist came again and listened to the women lamenting their fate. and the femalist told them that they were all being abused and raped by their husbands. and she told them to all get divorced and that they should have custody of the children because they made as much money as the men and could care for the children themselves. after all, they were strong and independent now. and the femalist told them that the men should pay half of the expenses of the children to the women out of their earnings. and so the women voted and expelled all the men from their homes. and the men built modest accommodations for themselves and conserved everything they could keep from their ex-wives. and they were not as happy as they were before, but they lived a decent existence. and the ex-wives were more miserable than ever. and the seamstress was covered in fine jewels and was waited upon by barbarian slaves she purchased from the nomadic tribe of chad. and the wives were jealous and hated her. and the femalist came again to the village and told all of the villagers that they needed for the women to ""lean in together"" and ""ban bossy"" so they could get ""more women in tech"" and elect the ""first woman president"" because ""yes means yes"" and ""end street harassment"". and finally the men of the village understood that they were hearing meaningless words. and that these were satanic incantations of a cunt-witch. and they tied the femalist to a stake and burned her to death. and they fucked whores from the chad tribe and told their ex-wives to go fuck themselves. and the men and the widow lived happily ever after."

The main thibng of jumper weapons is that they are made for jumping around and not dealing damage or to learn how to jump with certain weapons. Another problem is that this weapon has increased height and speed from jumps. Jumper weapons shouldn't have betetr movement than their normal counterparts. Learning with this weapon isn't possible because it doesnt provide the same movement as the normal weapon.

Everything is going well, I have annexed naxos, still hold negroponte, and still hold crete. I had to give up Durazzo and Corfu in a past war with the Ottomans. I am pursuing relations with Cypress, with the eventual plan to annex them and have major trade control. While things might seem fine for now, until i have to go to war with the Italian nations, war with the Ottomans is looming. They have a core of Negroponte, Naxos, and Crete, all major points of trade for my nation. I have a great relationship with Austria and Hungary, as well as the papal states, Im afraid that the Ottomans will go down and try to take full control of Greece before even attacking the Hungarian front. Should i start building up forces on the islands of Naxos and Negroponte? Should i produce a better navy to blockade my islands in case of war? Is is even worth it? Should I just give up those islands if war was to happen? I feel like my nation is backed up on a few islands in the Ottoman's territory and there is not much i could do, as the Ottomans have a better navy than me. Please help, as i think losing those provinces would give me a major loss on trade income. Thanks!"

Hi everyone, Just as hopefully everyone else on this sub, I love this game. But I've been having some difficulties, and I'll list them off in hope that some of you can help me out... 1. Houses. In my recent game I've had a terrible starvation where 90% of my population died off. As a result, my survivors were scattered across the map. So I closed buildings in favour of bunching my people up to close walking distance. So now all my people are living in different houses close together, so instead of at least adults coupling up everyone decided they needed their own house. So now, firewood was being used at an insane rate to heat all these barely populated homes. Do I have to demolish every single house to prevent this? A feature to 'close' houses would be perfect to prevent this perhaps. 2. Maps. As a noob player I find it frustrating to get maps that are littered with hills and lakes. Perhaps it's like that to make the game more challenging but can we have some maps that are flatter (noob friendlier...) that don't force me to stretch my town across thin valleys and make forester lodges a pain in the ass to place. I know there are mods for this but vanilla features for this would be wonderful! P.S. How does everyone manage to feed their town past the 150 population point? Nothing seems to help for me."

It will help lower your tolerance and help keep it from building back up. Try 500-750mg 3x daily. Also, find the dose that works for you and stay with it. Taking more and more to chase a feeling is a sure fire way to increase tolerance. Katom's effects can vary from day to day depending on many factors, and it seems like the mood lift can be the most variable. If you are having times where it doesn't seem to do much, taking more will pretty much guarantee that you will start to need more. If you just stick with your normal dose, it will start working again."

I don't know if the President can change that. -Comparative studies among developed countries that show the police killing rate reformers believe the US should aspire to...afaik these countries all have significant structural differences from the US (less untreated mental illness and less driving per capita as well as more provisions to keep guns and even knives out of the hands of troubled individuals). It might be possible that most US police killings are necessary and would occur in France or Canada under the same circumstances; it's just that those circumstances don't happen there as much as there's less driving, meaning less traffic stops and less concern about unarmed suspects squishing cops with 2 tons machinery, as well as better healthcare and better background checks for guns."

I have not sold a book in a month which seems to coincide when the book was released ii) It seems they have also joined a UK based online forum pretending to me and have flooded the forum with lewd images and harassed forum members whilst impersonating me. I believe the forum administrators are also debating legal action against me? They have closed all forms of communication with me as they believe I am responsible for the attacks Should I contact the police?

And before anyone starts to make connections between the 60's and now, please note that the race to the moon didn't start with kennedy's speech. Additionally, an 8-day mission is completely different than a 2.5 to 3-year mission. Maybe if the em drive pans out, but even then there are significant unsolved challenges. For example, the lunar Gravity is about 1/9 that of earth. Martian is about 1/3. The amount of fuel needed to blast off from Mars is significant. We just have a lot of challenges yet to solve, and no politician can make a plan with a timeline that involves developing new technology.

0,All I know is that I wouldn't want to be tunnel-brothers with Derrick.,pi22seven,relationships,1,-1,-1,2016-11,2016-11-17 05:53:05,"Me with girl I wanted to date but she ended up sleeping with my best friend now upset with me because I don't want to date her Wall of text incoming. You can skip to tl;dr but even that ended up being a little long. This is going to sound like a lot of high school bullshit and really it is. Back story is this. A group of friends and mine eat at a local pub once a week during football season and have done so for about 3 years. A new waitress started working there in July (before the season started but we eat there sometimes outside of game day). She was a knockout, beautiful brunette with really blue eyes. She starts waiting our table and she is very friendly. No big deal, its a waitresses job to be friendly so I never think anything about it. We come back in pre-season and she is still there and once again get our table. This time since we are there for a few hours to watch the game she spends a lot of time with us and she talks with me a lot. Now honestly I'm not the greatest at picking up on social cues, I always just assume that the wait staff is just trying to get an extra tip. But my friends in the past have told me I have blown opportunities when they say a girl was hitting on me so I kind of take a leap of faith here and I ask her if I can text her sometime. We exchange numbers and we start doing some very casual texting. Thursday of that week I have a client in town that I have to entertain for the night and well I thought I'd try my luck and see if she was there. Bingo, she's working and take our table all is good. Again she goes out of her way to stick around and talk with us, we came in late so they were closing and she came over and sat with us for awhile. Again I think things are going great. I text her the next day and tell her how happy I was to see her and she returns the feelings on this. Well Sunday comes we are there and once again she is there. Things go the exact same way so by this time I have really started to think that we are both leading towards something and I just decide that after the game I will ask her if she will go out with me sometime. Of course I do this away from everyone so as to not look creepy or anything. She turns me down flat. She say's that I have misread her and she enjoys talking and texting with me but she is not interested in seeing me in that way. Ouch. I'm a big boy, I apologize for misreading the situation and tell her that I won't trouble her again. Hey you swing you miss, it happens. I was not upset other than what you typically will feel when you get flat out rejected like that, but that's just life. A couple of weeks go by and she was not at work for the first game, which if I'm being honest i was a little relieved about. But she was there for the second one. This is when one of my friends ""Derrick"" leans over and tells me ""hey man you see that waitress there, I've been tapping that now for about 2 weeks"". Okay this all makes some sense now, she was just being friendly around me to get with Derrick, it sucks but hey its life. Now I happen to know that Derrick is a real douche canoe when it comes to women, he is a player and he sticks with them a month or two and then moves on. I like him as a guy but bluntly speaking I'm just not that way so it kind of bugs me when he does that because in the past myself and a few of the other guys have been caught in his damatic shitstorm when he runs into a woman who does not take kindly to this. Anyway I just totally put the whole thing out of my mind until about 2 weeks ago. Derrick as I knew he would dumped her. It really kind of upset some of the guys because he did this with a person where we go to frequently so this is going to be awkward for everyone. Sure as shit she is there when we come in but she did not take our table. It was very obvious that she traded off. However at half time of the game she catches me coming out of the bathroom and she starts chatting me up. I reply to her as I would any other time and then I return to the game. Then on Monday I get a text from her telling me how great it was to talk to me yesterday. I just replied back ""good talking to you as well"". That was it or so I thought. Then all of a sudden she starts texting me every day several times a day. Sometimes I don't even reply to her. Then the next Sunday she is once again working our table but she is totally focusing on me this time and pretty much just gives polite conversation to anyone else. Then when we were all leaving she runs up to me as says ""aren't you even going to say goodbye"", which confused the shit out of me. So I told her goodbye and she say's to me ""hey I've been thinking about you a lot lately and I really would like to go out with you sometime"". At this point I kind of had a feeling that this is where this was headed so I just simply told her ""yea, sorry but once someone tells me that they aren't interested in me then I try and move for my own sanity and that the ship had kind of sailed for that"". She gave me kind of a disgusted grunt and turned and left. It's over right? Wrong. The next day I get a wall of text that was fluctuated between anger and apologizing. Basically she said she spoke with Derrick after I rejected her and she found out that I knew about them. She then went into this long rant about how it was wrong for me to ""slut shame her"" for being with someone else when we were not even a couple. How that it was unfair that I really liked her but now that I found out she was with one of my friends that she was ""dirty"". I'll spare you the rest because it was a train wreck with her ending up apologizing for everything she said at the end. I sent back a very short response to her telling her that her dating Derrick had nothing to do with any of it. That her telling me that she did not think of me that way was the reason for all of it and now I didn't think of her that way. She then sent several texts trying to explain herself and ultimately I just ignored all of them because honestly she sounded like a dumpster fire. I eventually just texted her back and said at the end of the day she is an employee of a place I frequent and that is the relationship that we have. This did not go over well so I blocked her phone. Now WTF do I do about this sunday? As far as I'm concerned I've been going there a lot longer than she worked there, we were never a couple so I do not feel like I need to avoid the place. So if she has any form of attitude or badgers me do I tell her manager or should I try and get everyone to move to a different location? It would be one thing if I did what Derrick did but in the end for some reason I'm the bad guy and I've never even been out with this woman but I'm some sexist pig because she slept with one of my friends and now she thinks that is the reason I don't want to date her. tl;dr: Met waitress who was hot and thought we made a connection but I was wrong, she shot me down. No big deal I move on, one of my friends starts sleeping with her and as is par for his course dumps her after about a month. She then tries to hit me up again and this time I reject her, she flips her shit because she say's I'm sexist for rejecting her because she had sex with one of my friends. This was not the reason but now I'm afraid to go to my local pub."

He does not subscribe to any magazines at our home address, which is a PO box. I opened the mail to see if I could rip it into tiny pieces and mail back in a prepaid envelope, but you had to put a stamp on to return it. So I heaved it in the recycle bin in the post office lobby, and noticed quite a few people had also received the same big envelope and trashed it unopened. The mailing had like a dozen separate pieces of crap inside, all printed, so that had to cost money to prepare, print, collate, etc. Direct mail solicitations like that have a notoriously poor return ratio, so it's nice to see Trump is wasting money on ineffective, old-fashioned, expensive direct mail efforts.

As Rubaberoc well said in another post and i quote ""seeing as the Vanduul are based off of the Vandals, that hints at something: The Vandals were pushed into Roman territory because they were fleeing the even bigger and nastier threat of the Huns. Thus, it seems likely that the Vanduul are probably being chased into human territory by something even worse "" Well i have an idea. First point is each alian race has that tech that makes them different from humans. The xi'an have the better engine tech. The benu is still unknow ,the tevarin with their boarding ships and the vanduul are unknow also. But here is an idea. What about if the vanduul had the best jump drives. Makes sense as they are nomadic and tribal. So imagine when using their jump drive tech as u jump and look out at the jump tunnel u can see what look like truly demonic sceens. Shapes and monsters almost ripping into the jump tunnel with u. But never do. But in lore it could say that the vanduul pushed their jump drive tech too hard and ripped the jump tunnel open. Be it for a moment. And in come through truly horrific trans dimensional beings. Think of the movie Event horizon. And its this horror that the Vanduul are running from. It could be the new bad guy in 10 years when star citizen needs a reboot. What do u guys think?"

The current design of the client would have to change pretty dramatically to make this change because there's nothing behind the friends list in the updated client. If you minimized it, we'd have to dynamically stretch everything to fill the space. Remember, we've redesigned just about every page in the updated client to work using the current layout. And it's designed to fit comfortably at the current aspect ratio with the friends list basically sitting to the side of it. To get super real with y'all, we've had a few people saying this whenever they get access to the alpha, but we think it's mostly just because it's a change from the legacy client, and we're expecting it to die down on its own. No one has really brought up an interesting reason for redesigning everything just so you could minimize it as before. It's only really been ""I could before.""

They're both teenagers, one awkward dude and a pretty, attractive girl. I stand there waiting and the guy looks over, sees me, and then turns to continue talking to the girl. I am not really the kind of person to say ""excuse me!"" so I just stood there. I was waiting long enough to get my phone out and text my friend about the situation. So dude's really working it, trying to be funny. All the while she's occupying herself with some task and laughing politely. Dude is laughing hard at his own jokes and straight up ignoring me. Finally the girl sees me and nods in my direction, telling dude to go do his job. When he walks up, I am really pissed off. I'm not really in the business of confronting strangers, but this one bothered me more than usual. So I say loudly, ""hey, glad you could take a break from trying to bang your coworker to take my order."" At this, dude looks quickly to the girl and she visibly recoils and says, ""ugh, what?"" Dude tries to recover, saying he didn't notice me standing there, but the damage had been done. He looked defeated, girl looked extremely uncomfortable, and now I'm eating in the corner watching them actively ignore each other and pretend the other doesn't exist. Enjoy the rest of your shift, awkward teenage boy. Also, sorry about the collateral damage, teenage girl."

As frustrating as it is with conspiracy theorists (I mean I use that term even loosely because, as you mentioned, the extent of research these people do is a bunch of YouTube videos and Anonymous's Facebook feed nonsense) calling everyone who doesn't believe this trash ""sheeple"" and demanding that we ""wake up!"" and ""do research"" is equally as annoying as people who sit on the other side and attack them, saying that they're wearing ""tin foil hats"", that they are ""crazy"" and ""uninformed"". Honestly just let people form their own ideas even if they seem ridiculous. Their crazy ideas aren't hurting you. It seems that with social media everybody is quick to calling each other a *somethingist* and tell others how wrong they are. So what if they're wrong? and so what if someone doesn't believe what you do? It's exhausting, tiresome and pointless to try and convince a stranger on the internet to switch to your side, and it never happens. Basically I just hate both types of people with regards to this."

Trooper handling my case was sure he'd proven intent. I remember on the sting phone call when he got all excited and said based on what he said, we could prove intent... Charges were never brought by the special prosecutor. The state refuses to pay my medical bills or counseling. 40% of women in Alaska report being sexually assaulted at some point when surveyed, which is double the national average. It's the most beautiful place I've ever been. I've never been happier than when I was there. And I've never been more scared or had my soul squashed harder than when I was there.

I've always personally been a fan of armor acting as a damage subtraction modifier instead (essentially making high armor targets impervious to high rate of fire low damage weapons), since it at least is different, whereas the current system could be entirely eliminated in favor of just more base health. Then you can have armor *penetration*, which reduces how effective armor is at subtracting your damage, and a flat health type modifier which multiplies your damage according to its type. If you want a more involved system, just make armor its own health bar like shields, and make certain damage types reduce it over time. Damage type modifiers would affect armor health and enemy health separately, so you don't deal +1000% damage because the enemy has 1 armor point left."

It swelled to the point my ear was sticking out almost 90degrees from my head. It hurt so bad, I got an Exacto knife and stabbed it. The first time I stuck it in, I almost passed out. The second time, it broke thru and all the puss erupted out. After I squeezed all that out, it bled like hell for a while. It healed up nicely in a few days. My wife is a RN so she kept it cleaned and bandaged. If I can cut myself open, I think I could do it to someone else if there was no other option."

For example, in my current campaign a player has made a 'paladin of me'. His ego is so huge he has his own religion and a diplomacy of over 30 for converting people. He also managed to make the rest of the party (including a cleric of gorum) and my fire elemental sorcerer (who carries hope of godhood herself) the saints of his religion. He out diplomacied a contract demon. Seriously. The gm gave the devil a load of bonuses to his rolls and greyson the paladin still succeeded. He rolled two crits in a go and has his own church now after converting a fifth of the town that hires us, including war orphans (something he didn't have before due to travelling). The most my character did was make a magical nuke. XD"
